# JavaScript Project_Tic Tac Toe

This is a project originally from <a href="https://github.com/WebDevSimplified/JavaScript-Tic-Tac-Toe">WebDevSimplified</a>. I rewrote the JavaScript part on my own after I learnt how to do it. Also, I made it prettier by adding a constantly changing colourful background and giving the noughts and crosses some gradient colours.

Playing this tic-tac-toe (noughts and crosses) game is easy, just click on the white board to place your mark.
